Key Steps Involved:

Data Collection and Preparation:

Imported the dataset and examined its structure.
Handled missing values and outliers through appropriate techniques.
Converted data types and formatted variables as needed for analysis.
Descriptive Statistics:

Calculated summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical variables.
Assessed the distribution of categorical variables through frequency tables.
Data Visualization:

Created visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
Used bar charts and pie charts for categorical data analysis.
Generated correlation heatmaps to identify correlations between numerical variables.
Pattern and Trend Analysis:

Identified trends, seasonality, and anomalies in the data.
Segmented the data into meaningful categories to explore patterns within subgroups.
Insights and Recommendations:

Summarized key findings from the EDA.
Provided actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.
Highlighted interesting patterns or anomalies for further investigation.
Tools and Technologies:

Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Outcome:
By the end of this project, I gained a thorough understanding of the dataset, uncovered hidden patterns and relationships, and derived actionable insights to guide future analyses and business strategies. The findings from this EDA were documented in a detailed report, complemented by visualizations and summary statistics, providing a solid foundation for more advanced modeling and analysis.

This project showcased my ability to handle real-world data, apply statistical techniques, and use visualization tools to derive meaningful insights, demonstrating essential skills for data analysis and data-driven decision-making.
